# Visualize Music

This is the practice tool that I wish I had when I was first learning to play 
music. It will highlight chords, scales, recommend excercises, keep tempo, and 
save user-created chords for later use. Learning about and practicing music are
two very different activities and this app will help bridge the gap between the
two.

# visualMusic

This project will function as an advanced practice tool for all things music! 

***Update***

This was the first iteration of the music app. I realized that I was writing a lot of code 
that manipulated the DOM so I decided to learn a front-end framework to help me with the
growing complexity of the UI. Below is the link to the second iteration of the project I 
started working on once I learned enough React.
